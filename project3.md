## Project description

This project is a file encryption service that will take a user designated file and a user designated encryption algorithm, pulled from a list of provided encryptions from the UI. The user will start by running the program, which will then ask the user to provide a file. After it verifies that the file exists, the UI will present a list of several encryption algorithms that the user can use on the file. Then, the program will process the form of encryption and print out a completion statement once finished. The program will show the user where the file was saved to. A prompt will appear, asking if the user wishes to decrypt the file or quit the program. Once it is decrypted, the file's location will be displayed (in the same place as the encrypted file) and the program will exit.

## How to compiles / run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

Step 1: Install the Netbeans IDE, version 8.1 or later.<br>
Step 2: Clone all files from the Github repository into a folder.<br>
Step 3: Launch the Netbeans IDE and select "Open Project".<br>
Step 4: Navigate to the project folder.<br>
Step 5: Open the project.<br>
Step 6: Highlight the "EncrypMain.java" file.<br>
Step 7: Click "Run Project".<br>

## UI Design

The program is not very UI interactive in itself, but the Netbeans IDE is an interaction-based UI as a whole. However, the focus is not on the Netbeans IDE, but the program itself. Once the user starts the "EncrypMain.java",

## 4. Additional Credit

This project was not based upon a single student's work. Rather, it was the work of several students including myself. Those students are Trevor Abel, Ryan Hinson, and Alex Lopez. This project could not have come to fruition without their help. All code and work has been credited to the proper authors.
