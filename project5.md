## Project description

This project was a team-based project, where my team and I were tasked with building a website for a small medical university. I will be showcasing the work that I have done in this project, being the backend developer. As a result, instructions will not be given to run/compile this project. Not from me not wanting to give instructions, but from the inability to do so. 

## UI Design

This project operated around the "low-code" design, which is essentially a way to build a web application with very little code. However, this does not mean that the finished product will lack the functionality of a typical web application. Appsmith provides a way to link multiple datasources and create multiple APIs to interact with JavaScript snippets.

## 3. Additional Considerations

Even though I primarily worked on the backend, this is still a team project. However, this project was not fully finished due to time constraints and scheduling conflicts. The team members I worked with were Edward "Matt" Phillips, Adam Thiemann, Blake Collins, Brian Diaz, and Lucas Neidlinger.
